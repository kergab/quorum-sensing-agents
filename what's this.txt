What's this?


This is the modellinng program I wrote for my bachelor thesis.

The purpose of the software is to model systems comprised of individual agents in a two-dimensional environment, with substrates governed by differential equations. The model I implemented is a self-improved microbiological one (a quorum sensing and swarming model of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium).

This version is yet to be properly parameterized to produce biologically relevant simulations.
